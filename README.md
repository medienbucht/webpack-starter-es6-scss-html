# webpack-starter-es6-scss-html
Webpack starting config using babel/es6, scss and webpack server

Run `npm install` and then `npm run start` for dev server or `npm run build` for production build.

Inspired by [this blog post](https://www.valentinog.com/blog/webpack-tutorial/) for the basics and [this](https://wanago.io/2018/07/16/webpack-4-course-part-two-webpack-4-course-part-two-loaders/) for scss support.
